# Digital-Pin-Status
I have a Program that reads Digital PINS of Arduino UNO. I have turned on all the Digital PINS by default by using "PULLUP" keyword. Now if I insert "Jumper Wire" into any Digital PIN it is PULLDOWN(Keyword). I am reading the states of Digital PINS continuously after an interval of 0.5ms (This Interval is coded in Arduino IDE) and it gives me "1" and "0", if Jumper wire is pulled into any Digital PIN it will give "0" else it will give "1".        Then the "0" and "1" are stored in two arrays namely "predata for maintaining previous state, newdata for maintaining current state" of the Digital PINS and Displays the states on GUI Screen.   On Running Arduino UNO first time the "newdata" and "predata" are Same. Then i have an Infinite While loop that reads Digital PINS continuously and stores them in an "curdata" array and compares it with "predata" array. If "predata" and "curdata" arrays does not match it stores the all the values of "curdata" array are written into the "predata" and Displayed on GUI Screen.
